# Booting the Pi

Now that those settings are done, you can boot up the Raspberry Pi. 

1) Insert the SD Card into the back of the Raspberry Pi. 
2) If you need to do any of the settings once it's booted, connect a monitor and a keyboard.
3) Connect your Public Internet to the secondary adapter and the Lighting network to the onboard adapter.
4) Insert the power and let it boot up

If you are booting with a screen to finish the settings above, you can remove the keyboard and screen once you are done.
