# Install Git

To be able to clone the LX Monitor project, you must first install Git. To do so, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

You will also need git installed on your computer, to make and push changes to your configuration before deploying it to your Raspberry Pi. Take a look at the [official guide to installing git][OfficialGitInstall] for information on how to do that. If you are looking for a graphical client, [GitKraken][GKClient] is one of the easiest to use.
